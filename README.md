# Team-Based Inquiry Learning (Calculus 1)

The items here are the source files for the workbook I am using in my Fall 2024 Calculus 1 course, which is using the [Team-Based Inquiry Learning](https://tbil.org) framework. The compiled and digital version is [located here](https://cg2wilson.github.io/calc-1-tbil).

If you notice any issues, you're encouraged to make an issue using Github's [issue tracker](https://github.com/cg2wilson/calc-1-tbil/issues).
