# Observations/Commentary

## Specific Sections

### L1

Total time was approximately 120 minutes; part of this is based on the time it takes to organize when starting the course, I think. Another part is some ambiguous wording in the workbook. Items to look at:
- Activity 1.1.7
- Activity 1.1.8
- Activity 1.1.11

Specifically, students noted that both the tables and the options weren't necessarily worded in a clear way (e.g. approximation vs. estimation, definitions) and that the presentation was slightly confusing.

**To do**: Reword these activities. Prepare class better for aesthetics of the pretext deployment

### L2

Time on 8/28: 20 minutes
Time on 9/4: 

Same issue on Activity 1.2.2 as with the tables in L1- some confusion with the layout of the table and the expectation in the answer choices.

## Objectives and Pacing

8/28: 
- L3 is sort of already discussed in the readiness material for Module L; is it worth having this as a separate objective at all?
- L1 is taking more time than anticipated, due largely to 1) ambiguities or confusions in wording of prompts and/or tables. Increase time here.
