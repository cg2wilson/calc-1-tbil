Given points and on a line, the slope of the line is found by If we write and , then we can rewrite slope as      Three Forms of a Line  A line is in slope-intercept form slope-intercept form if it is written as where is the slope of the line and is the location of the intercept.

The limit can be approximated to be 1 because the data in the table and the graph show that from the left and the right the function approaches 1 as goes to 2.
