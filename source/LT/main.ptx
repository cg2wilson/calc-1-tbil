    <introduction>
      <p>
        This module describes the concept of and use of a fundamental concept in Calculus- the idea of a limit. It contains four learning targets:

        <li>
          <title>LT1</title>
          <p>
            I can use a graph or table to determine the limit (one-sided or two-sided) of a function.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>LT2</title>
          <p>
            I can use limit laws and algebraic techniques to compute the one-sided or two-sided limit of a function.

        </li>
        <li>
          <title>LT3</title>
          <p>
            I can compute limits of functions as the input becomes unbounded, and also as the output becomes unbounded.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>LT4</title>
          <p>
            I can identify where a function is contininuous (on an interval or at a point), and describe the type of discontinuity.
