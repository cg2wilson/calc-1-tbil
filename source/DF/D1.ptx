        <!-- 
        I think that the general structure goes like this:
            1) Activity finding slope of a line
            2) Activity finding slope of a polynomial with deg(P) > 1
            3) Transition language from "slope" to "average rate of change"
            4) Define AROC
            5) Reword d-aroc-activity-ball1 so that average rate of change can be related to average velocity
            6) Extract conjecture about what happens to AROC as interval decreases
        7) Definition of instantaneous rate of change
        8) Interpretations of instantaneous rate of change
        9) Preview-type questions involving alternate expressions for the difference quotient

                    In this activity you will study the velocity of a ball falling under gravity. The height of the ball (in feet) is given by the formula <m> f(t) = 64-16(t-1)^2</m>, where <m>t</m> is measured in seconds. For your convenience, below you will find a table of values for <m>f(t)</m>.

                        To start we will look at an interval of length one before <m>t=2</m> and after <m>t=2</m>, so we consider the intervals <m>[1,2]</m> and <m>[2,3]</m>. What was the average velocity on the interval <m>[1,2]</m>? What about on the interval <m>[2,3]</m>?

                        Now let's consider smaller intervals of length <m>0.5</m>. What was the average velocity on the interval <m>[1.5,2]</m>? What about on the interval <m>[2,2.5]</m>?

                        If we wanted to approximate the velocity at the instant <m>t=2</m>, what would be your best estimate for this velocity? We call a rate of change at a single instant (rather than over an interval) the <em>instantaneous rate of change</em>, or <em>instantaneous velocity</em> in this context.
