  <title>Partial Derivatives (PD)</title>

  <objectives>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        This module describes the conceptual development and computational development of the partial derivative, as well as some of its uses.

        <li>
          <title>PD1</title>
          <p>
            I can work with functions of multiple variables, including identifying contour curves, level surfaces, and quadric surfaces.

        </li>
        <li>
          <title>PD2</title>
          <p>
            I can compute the limit of a function of multiple variables and identify where a function of two variables is discontinuous.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>PD3</title>
          <p>
            Given a multivariable function, I can compute its partial derivatives of any order, interpret their meaning in context, and use them to find the equation of the tangent plane to a surface.

        </li>
        <li>
          <title>PD4</title>
          <p>
            Given a multivariable function, I can compute its directional derivative in a given direction, and determine/interpret its gradient vector
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>PD5</title>
          <p>
            I can locate and classify the critical points of a function of two variables using the Second Derivative Test, and find the absolute extrema for a surface
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>PD6</title>
          <p>
            I can use Lagrange Multipliers to solve optimization problems with constraints.
