    <introduction>
      <p>
        This module describes the conceptual development and computational development of the derivative. It contains nine learning targets:

    </introduction>
      <dl>
        <li>
          <title>DE1</title>
          <p>
            I can use a limit definition to compute derivatives at a point, explain how average rates of change are used in the process, and interpret the meaning of the derivative in context.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>DE2</title>
          <p>
            I can use the limit definition to compute the derivative function.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>DE3</title>
          <p>
            I can sketch the derivative graph of a function and determine where it is differentiable (and classify the non-differentiability type) using numerical, algebraic, or graphical representations.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>DE4</title>
          <p>
            I can apply derivative shortcuts to compute derivatives of the following kinds of functions and their linear combinations: polynomials, exponentials, logarithms, trigonometric functions.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>DE5</title>
          <p>
            I can use the product rule and the quotient rule to compute the derivative of products or quotients of functions. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>DE6</title>
          <p>
            I can use the chain rule to compute the derivative of composite functions, as well as in conjunction with other rules.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>DE7</title>
          <p>
            I can use implicit differentiation to take derivatives of implicit equations. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>DE8</title>
          <p>
            I can compute the derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions and compute the derivative of the inverse of a one-to-one function.
          </p>
        </li>
