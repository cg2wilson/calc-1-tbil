    <introduction>
      <p>
        This module describes the conceptual development and computational development of the derivative. It contains nine learning targets:

    </introduction>
      <dl>
        <li>
          <title>DE1</title>
          <p>
            I can compute and interpret the average rate of change between two points, and describe its relationship to instantaneous rate of change
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>DE2</title>
          <p>
            I can apply the definition of the derivative and use it to calculate, approximate, and interpret the derivative at a point or as a function
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>DE3</title>
          <p>
            I can interpret the meaning of a derivative in context (with appropriate units)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>DE4</title>
          <p>
            Given a graph, I can sketch its derivative.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>DE5</title>
          <p>
            I can graphically, numerically, or algebraically determine where a function is differentiable 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>DE6</title>
          <p>
            I can apply shortcuts to determine derivatives of any order of the following types of functions and their linear combinations: polynomials, exponentials, logarithms, trigonometrics, inverse trigonometrics. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>DE7</title>
          <p>
            I can compute derivatives using one or more of the following rules or techniques: product, quotient, inverse. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>DE8</title>
          <p>
            I can compute derivatives using the chain rule by itself and with other rules
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>DE9</title>
          <p>
            I can use implicit differentiation to find the derivative of an equation
          </p>
        </li>
