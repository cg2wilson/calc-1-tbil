                When talking about an instantaneous rate of change, present progessive verbs should be used (-ing words). This is because the change <em>is happening at this moment in time</em>, as opposed to an averate rate of change, which occurs <em>over a period of time</em>.

                    Suppose that <m>S(t)</m> gives the amount of fuel (in pounds) consumed by a prototype space capsule being developed by an aerospace company, <m>t</m> minutes after leaving the International Space Station (ISS), and that <m>E(t)</m> gives the amount of fuel (in pounds) consumed by the capsule <m>t</m> minutes after leaving its launchpad.
