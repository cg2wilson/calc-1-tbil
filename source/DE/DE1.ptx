                    I can use a limit definition to compute derivatives at a point, explain how average rates of change are used in the process, and interpret the meaning of the derivative in context.

                        To start we will look at an interval of length one before <m>t=2</m> and after <m>t=2</m>, so we consider the intervals <m>[1,2]</m> and <m>[2,3]</m>. What was the average velocity on the interval <m>[1,2]</m>? What about on the interval <m>[2,3]</m>?

                        If we wanted to approximate the velocity at the instant <m>t=2</m>, what would be your best estimate for this velocity? We call a rate of change at a single instant (rather than over an interval) the <em>instantaneous rate of change</em>, or <em>instantaneous velocity</em> in this context.

                When talking about an instantaneous rate of change, present progessive verbs should be used (-ing words). This is because the change <em>is happening at this moment in time</em>, as opposed to an averate rate of change, which occurs <em>over a period of time</em>.
