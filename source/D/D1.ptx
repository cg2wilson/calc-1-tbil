                    I can compute and interpret the average rate of change between two points, and describe its relationship to instantaneous rate of change.

                <p>
                    In this activity you will study the velocity of a ball falling under gravity. The height of the ball (in feet) is given by the formula <m> f(t) = 64-16(t-1)^2</m>, where <m>t</m> is measured in seconds. For your convenience, below you will find a table of values for <m>f(t)</m>.

                        To start we will look at an interval of length one before <m>t=2</m> and after <m>t=2</m>, so we consider the intervals <m>[1,2]</m> and <m>[2,3]</m>. What was the average velocity on the interval <m>[1,2]</m>? What about on the interval <m>[2,3]</m>?
                    </p>
                </statement>
            </task>

                    <p>
                        Now let's consider smaller intervals of length <m>0.5</m>. What was the average velocity on the interval <m>[1.5,2]</m>? What about on the interval <m>[2,2.5]</m>?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        What was the average velocity on the interval <m>[1.75,2]</m>? What about on the interval <m>[2,2.25]</m>?

                    <p>
                        If we wanted to approximate the velocity at the instant <m>t=2</m>, what would be your best estimate for this instantaneous velocity?
