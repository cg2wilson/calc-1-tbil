                    I can apply the definition of the derivative and use it to calculate, approximate, and interpret the derivative at a point or as a function.

<!-- 
    outline: 
    1) Find equations of tangent lines
    2) Define the derivative at a point 
    3) Compute the derivative by hand (x2, x3 examples)
    4) Transition to derivative as a function
    5) Notation
    6) Notation examples
    7) Compute derivative function by hand
    8) Throwback to the ball example
    9) Another application, maybe volume/surface area and/or area/circumference (include equation of tangent line here)
