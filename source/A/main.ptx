        <li>
          <title>A1</title>
          <p>
            I can compute and interpret the average rate of change between two points, and describe its relationship to instantaneous rate of change

        </li>
        <li>
          <title>A2</title>
          <p>
            I can apply the definition of the derivative and use it to calculate, approximate, and interpret the derivative at a point or as a function
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>A3</title>
          <p>
            I can interpret the meaning of a derivative in context (with appropriate units)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>A4</title>
